### Danny Byrnes

Welcome. I am a software engineer based in San Francisco. I work in the fields of computer vision and state estimation (**VIO/SLAM**), utilizing image, IMU, and lidar sensor data to estimate the pose of mobile devices. In addition to VIO, I've worked on projects related to point cloud alignment, plane estimation, camera calibration, occupancy mapping, RANSAC, and ML compilers. Most of my software development experience is in C, C++, and Python. I am a member of the Imaging & Sensing Technology Group at Apple. 

I received my BA in Mathematics from [Bowdoin College][bowdoin], and an MS from [ICME][icme] at Stanford University. Outside of work I enjoy running, swimming, and skiing. My goal for this website is to post little side projects I find entertaining, and perhaps writing samples. All thoughts and opinions are my own.
