## Numerical Methods Review (Part II)

In [Part I]({% post_url 2025-04-06-JAX-numerical-methods %}) we covered Euler and Newton's Methods.
This post will continue with the following topics:
* Gauss-Newton Method
* Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm
* Cholesky Factorization 
    - Gram-Schmidt

# Gauss-Newton Method
Optimization method that iteratively minimizes some function using first-order information.

# Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm

# Cholesky Factorization 
This matrix factorization is suitable for hermitian positive definite matrices. If we limit our consideration to matrices in real space then we can simply say symmetric positive definite matrices.

#### Gram-Schmidt

# QR Decomposition
